# Safe And Secure Route Finding In Terrain Area | ML Algorithms, High-resolution satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM).
• Developed an optimal route-finding system using High-resolution satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to analyse rough terrains, incorporating terrain classification for better off-road navigation.

• Designed algorithms to compute safe and efficient routes by considering slope, elevation, obstacles, and real-time  weather data, enhancing dynamic route adjustments and disaster response capabilities.
