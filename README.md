# Safe-and-Secure-Route-Finding-in-Terrain-areas
This project builds a satellite-based route finder using high-resolution imagery and DEMs to analyze terrain and determine safe, efficient paths. It factors in slope, elevation, and obstacles, adapting routes with real-time weather for safer navigation in rough or disaster-prone areas.
